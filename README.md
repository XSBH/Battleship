Battleship
==========

Battleship is the Python edition of the battleship boardgame that I wrote for my Introduction to Computer Science course. 

How To Play
-------
Game is pretty self explanatory. Player can choose dimensions for the board, the number of ship, and wether to play with computer or another player.
After clicking start the game interface be set up according to player inputs.
If playing with a computer, the program will randomly select a coordinate each time after the players turn until a winner is announced. If playing with another player, the players take turns picking coordinates until a winner is announced.
